# Math

## `inc(value: Value)`

Increment value by one.

## `dec(value: Value)`

Decrement value by one.

## `toRad(node: Node): Node`

Transforms an angle from degrees to radians.

```js
(deg: Node) => Node;
```

## `toDeg(node: Node): Node`

Transforms an angle from radians to degrees.

```js
toDeg(rad: Node) => Node
```

## `min(...nodes: Node[]): Node`

Takes one or more nodes as input and returns the minimum of all the node's values.
This is equivalent to `Animated.min` but with support for more than two parameters.

```js
min(...args: Node[]) => Node
```

## `max(...nodes: Node[]): Node`

Takes one or more nodes as input and returns the maximum of all the node's values.
This is equivalent to `Animated.min` but with support for more than two parameters.

```js
max(...args: Node[]) => Node
```

## `clamp(node: Node, lowerBound: Adaptable, upperBound: Adaptable)`

Clamps a node with a lower and upper bound.

```js
clamp(new Value(-1), 0, 100); // 0
clamp(new Value(1), 0, 100); // 1
clamp(new Value(101), 0, 100); // 100
```

##  between = (node: Node, lowerBound: Adaptable, upperBound: Adaptable, inclusive: boolean)

Returns true if `node` is within `lowerBound` and `upperBound`.

## `approximates(value: Node, approximatesTo: Node, precision = 0.001): number`

Returns 1 if the difference between the two values is less than precision.
Otherwise returns 0.
Default value for the precision is 0.001.

## `atan2(node: Node): Node`

Returns the angle in the plane (in radians) between the positive x-axis and the ray from (0,0) to the point (x,y), `atan2(y,x)`.

```js
atan2(y: Node, x Node) => Node
```

## `cubicBezier(t: Node, p0: Node, p1: Node, p2: Node, p3: Node): Node`

Returns the coordinate of a cubic bezier curve.
`t` is the length of the curve from 0 to 1. `cubicBezier(0, p0, p1, p2, p3)` equals `p0` and `cubicBezier(1, p0, p1, p2, p3)` equals `p3`.
`p0` and `p3` are respectively the starting and ending point of the curve.
`p1` and `p2` are the control points.
