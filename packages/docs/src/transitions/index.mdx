# Transitions

Transitions are essential to the user experience.
Redash offers four utility functions for transitions which are broke down in the table below.
If you want to build a transition based on a React state change use `useTimingTransition()` or `useSpringTransition()`.
To transition an animation value change, use `withTimingTransition()` or `withSpringTransition()`.

|        | State (JS Thread)      | Value (UI Thread)        |
| ------ |:----------------------:| ------------------------:|
| Timing | useTimingTransition()  | withTimingTransition()   |
| Spring | useSpringTransition()  | withSpringTransition()   |

## Attach a transition to a state

```tsx
import {useTimingTransition} from "react-native-redash";

const Toggle = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
  const transition = useTimingTransition(open, { duration: 400 });
}
```

## Attach a transition to an animation value

```tsx
import {useTimingTransition} from "react-native-redash";

const Toggle = () => {
  const open = new Value<number>(0);
  const transition = withTimingTransition(open, { duration: 400 });
}
```
